Features I want in priority order:


- (2) Get some defaults about repos (pooling pull requests)
      Can reuse some of the components about pull request tables
- (3) For pull requests I'm reviewing, I want to see reviews that I approved but have since changed
- (2) Support gravitar images


Finished (should add these to my bookmarks in a separate folder)
- (2) loading screen
